/*Player's Direction Vector (dir_x and dir_y): These variables represent
the direction in which the player is facing. They form a vector that points
from the player's position into the game world.

Camera Plane (plane_x and plane_y): The camera plane is a concept used in
raycasting to simulate a player's field of view. It's a 2D plane that is
perpendicular to the player's direction vector. The camera plane is positioned 
in front of the player and determines how much of the game world is visible to
the player.

- plane_x represents the X-coordinate of the camera plane.
It determines the "width" of the player's field of view. A larger
value will create a narrower field of view, while a smaller value will
create a wider field of view.
- plane_y represents the Y-coordinate of the camera plane.
It interacts with the player's direction vector to create a sense of
perspective and depth.

Rendering: When rendering the scene, the camera plane, player's direction vector,
and other parameters are used to cast rays from the player's position into the
game world. These rays simulate the player's line of sight, and their intersections
with walls and objects are used to create the 3D effect on the 2D screen.*/
